# Libft

Your very first own library

Summary:
This project is about coding a C library.
It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon.

Introduction:
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them. I created my own library. It will be helpful since I will use it in my next C school assignments.
Libft is continually being expanded over time with the arising need of other basic functions in oncoming projects.
