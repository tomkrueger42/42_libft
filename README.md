# 42_libft
Very first 42 school project about creating a library with helpful functions that augment other projects and reduce the use of system calls.

The project consists of two parts: the "mandatory" functions and the "bonus" functions.

Use the Makefile to compile the library. The "all" rule will compile only the "mandatory" part, the "bonus" will compile all functions. Compiling results in the libft.a file.
